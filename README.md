# EditConfig
A set of all my preffered configs

### terminator_config
[Terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html) config file with [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) theme, and a backup profile, with the same name. Be attention to "title" name; put *youruser@domain*. Besides, you'll need to install [Fira Code](github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font for that works.
The file need to be replaced on `~/.config/terminator/config` (on Ubuntu-based systems)
