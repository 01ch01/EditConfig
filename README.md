# EditConfig
A set of all my preffered configs

### config
[Terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html) config file with [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) theme, and a backup profile, with the same name. Be attention to "title" name; put *youruser@domain*. Besides, you'll need to install [Fira Code](github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font for that works.
The file need to be replaced on `$HOME/.config/terminator/config` (on Ubuntu-based systems).

### .hyper.js
[Hyper Terminal](https://hyper.is/) config file with [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/hyper) theme. This file need to be replaced on `$HOME/.hyper.js` (on Ubuntu-based systems).

### .vimrc
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) config file. First, type on your terminal `sudo apt install vim -y` to install VIM. This file need to be replaced on `$HOME/.vimrc` (on Ubuntu-based systems).
